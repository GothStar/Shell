Shell is a simple package that gives you the ability to call shell commands through Swift.

## Usage

Run (sync):

```swift
import Shell

let output = try Shell().run("ls ~")
```

Run (async):

```swift
import Shell

Shell().run("sleep 2 && ls ~") { result, error in
    //...
}
```

Shell (bash) with environment variables:

```swift
import Shell

let shell = Shell("/bin/bash", env: ["ENV_SAMPLE_KEY": "Hello world!"])
let out = try shell.run("echo $ENV_SAMPLE_KEY")
```

You can even set custom ouptut & error handlers.
